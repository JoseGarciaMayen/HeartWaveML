## Features
- Data ***preprocessing*** and ***feature extraction*** from raw ECG signals.

- ***Tuning and training*** of various ML models using ***tensorflow***.

- Model ***evaluation*** using appropriate metrics for multiclass classification.

- Experiment tracking using ***MLflow***.

- ***Notebook*** for interactive experiments and visualization [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/josegarciamayen/heartwaveml)

- ***DVC*** with ***Dagshub s3 bucket*** for data versioning and keeping track of our models.

- ***Docker + FastAPI*** to serve an easy-to-use interactive API.

- ***Continuous Integration*** (CI) using Github Actions.


## Quick Start
There are three ways to run ***HeartWaveML***:

### 1️⃣ Run only the API (via Docker)
If you only need the API, simply pull the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/josegm61/heartwaveml/tags) (<600MB):

```bash
docker pull josegm61/heartwaveml:latest
docker run -p 8000:8000 josegm61/heartwaveml:latest
```

The API will be running on http://localhost:8000
You can open `web/index.html` in your browser to interact with it. You can also see every endpoint at the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 2️⃣ Use pretrained models and datasets (via DVC)
If you want to use the trained models and datasets:
```bash
dvc pull
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will fetch the models and datasets tracked with DVC and install dependencies (you probably will need a [Dagshub account](https://dagshub.com/))

### 3️⃣ Train models from scratch
If you prefer to generate the dataset and train the models yourself:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.data.generate_data
python -m src.tuning.tune_convxgb.py
```
You can tune or train the model you want by changing `src.tuning.tune_convxgb.py` and use the api with
```bash
python -m src.api
```
This is the recommended option if you want to use this repo as a template to train your own models and try other combinations

## Clinical Impact

This model provides a scalable solution for cardiac monitoring, combining ***clinical-grade*** reliability with unparalleled ***speed***.

- ***High-Accuracy Screening***: 98.5% accuracy ensures reliable detection of 5 types of cardiac conditions, a rate comparable to human experts.

- ***Real-Time Analysis***: With an average inference time of under 50 ms per heartbeat, the system enables real-time, continuous monitoring, and the rapid processing of massive datasets.

- ***Augments Professional Expertise***: By automating the initial screening process, the system frees up healthcare professionals to focus their expertise on complex cases and direct patient care.

## Dataset

We use the [MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database](https://physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/), a widely used benchmark dataset for ECG signal classification. The dataset contains 48 half-hour recordings of two-lead ambulatory ECG signals sampled at 360 Hz. Each recording is annotated with beat labels, indicating the type of each heartbeat according to standard conventions.

Each ECG segment is resampled or cropped to 187 samples, then scaled and filtered. The process of filtering and scaling is a must to improve our models performance:

![Signal](https://github.com/JoseGarciaMayen/HeartWaveML/blob/main/assets/plot.png)

There are lots of heartbeats types:

![Type Distribution](https://github.com/JoseGarciaMayen/HeartWaveML/blob/main/assets/type_distribution.png)

So we map them into 5 classes:

```python
class_mapping = {
    'N': 0, '·': 0, 'L': 0, 'R': 0, 'e': 0, 'j': 0,           # Normal beat
    'A': 1, 'a': 1, 'J': 1, 'S': 1,                           # Supraventricular ectopic beat
    'V': 2, 'E': 2,                                           # Ventricular ectopic beat
    'F': 3,                                                   # Fusion beat
    '/': 4, 'f': 4, 'x': 4, 'Q': 4, '|': 4, '~': 4            # Unknown beat
}
```

And we end up with this distribution:

<div align="center">

| Class | Count |
|--------|-------|
| **0** | 90608 |
| **1** | 2781 |
| **2** | 7235 |
| **3** | 802 |
| **4** | 8981 |

</div>

We also applied SMOTE to fix the extreme class imbalance oversampling classes 1 and 3 to 5000 samples.

```python
sampling_strategy_dict = {
    3: 5000, 1: 5000
    }

    smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=sampling_strategy_dict, random_state=42, k_neighbors=5)
```

And then we split the data into train, validation and test. To do some tests, we created various datasets:

<div align="center">

| Dataset | Description |
|--------|-------|
| **base** | Scaled and filtered signal |
| **cnn** | Features extracted by CNN  |
| **feat** | Signal + Engineered features |
| **feat_only** | Engineered features |

</div>
